# 🛡️ AEGIS-1T: TERABYTE-SCALE MFA VAULT

Aegis-1T is a high-performance cryptographic utility designed to secure sensitive data ranging from 1-byte configuration files to **1TB+ databases**. It bridges the gap between massive data storage and physical multi-factor authentication (MFA).

---

## **🚀 KEY FEATURES**

* **⚡ Hybrid Streaming Engine**
    Custom-built to process massive files using a buffered I/O system. Maintains a constant RAM footprint of **<100MB** regardless of file size.
* **📱 Offline MFA Integration**
    Hardened security via Google Authenticator (TOTP). The vault remains cryptographically locked unless the 6-digit physical key is provided.
* **🔑 Argon2id Key Derivation**
    Implements the industry-leading **Argon2id** algorithm to ensure maximum resistance against GPU-accelerated brute-force attacks.
* **🔐 Authenticated Encryption**
    Utilizes **AES-256-GCM** to provide high-speed confidentiality and built-in integrity checking (tamper detection).
* **🧹 Secure Shredder**
    Includes a "Zero-Fill" protocol that overwrites data with null bytes (`0x00`) before deletion to prevent forensic recovery.
